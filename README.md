# Sentiment Analysis
In this project Amazon SageMaker is used to create and deploy a WebApp that is able to predict whether movie reviews are positive or negative.
Unfortunatley the WebApp can not be used, since deploying the model on AWS servers would cause permanent costs.
The general use of the App with a running server can be seen in the gif below.
